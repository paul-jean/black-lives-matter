# Calibrate!

## What is Calibrate?
Calibrate is a text bot that helps you track and optimize your medicinal cannabis.

## How does it work?
Calibrate understands updates like:

- "a puff of white widow"
- "2 puffs of cbd skunk haze"
- "two drops of midnight oil"
- "10 drops of cbda oil"

Calibrate will text you back in 30 minutes for "puff" updates, or in 90 minutes
for "drops" updates. When you get the text, you can choose to send an update on how you're feeling.

Over time more types of updates can be understood by Calibrate, prompting it to check back at the appropriate time.
